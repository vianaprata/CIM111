				<h2 id="brief_history">Brief History</h2>
				<p> Brazil was officially "discovered" in 1500, when a fleet commanded by Portuguese
					diplomat Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, on its way to India, landed in Porto Seguro, between
					Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. At the end of the 17th century, the news that fabulous
					veins of emeralds, diamonds, and gold had been found in Minas Gerais exploded in Lisbon.
					The region began to export 30,000 pounds of gold a year to Portugal. Bandeirantes and
					other fortune hunters rushed in from all over, and boat loads of carpenters, stonemasons,
					sculptors, and painters came from Europe to build cities in the Brazilian wilderness. Pedro II's
					daughter, Princess Isabel, officially ended slavery in 1888. Soon after, disgruntled
					landowners united with the military to finish with monarchy altogether, forcing the
					royal family back to Portugal and founding Brazil's first republican government on
					November 15, 1889.

				<p> The country is divided into 5 main regions: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> North (Norte). </li>
					<li> Northeast (Nordeste). </li>
					<li> Central-West (Centro-Oeste). </li>
					<li> Southeast (Sudeste). </li>

				<h2 id="main_cultural_points">Main Cultural Points</h2>
				<p> The cultures of the indigenous Indians, Africans, and Portuguese have together
					formed the modern Brazilian way of life. The Portuguese culture is by far the dominant
					of these influences; from it Brazilians acquired their language, their main religion,
					and most of their customs. African influences on the Brazilian way of life are strongest
					along the coast between the Northeast and Rio de Janeiro; they include traditional
					foods, religions, and popular music and dance, especially the samba. Brazil is often
					said to be the country of samba and football,
					and it would be a difficult task to decide which
					one is more popular.

					<p> I was born in a city called Belo Horizonte, but moved to Rio de Janeiro when I was young. My heart belongs to Rio de Janeiro and I feel completely'Carioca'; a term
						used to describe a person from Rio de Janeiro who has certain characteristics. Rio de Janeiro is a coastal city in Brazil on the southeast of the country.
						After Salvador, Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil from 1763 to 1961 (almost 200 years). Brasilia was then created
						and has been the capital since 1961.</p>

    <h2 id="football"> Football </h2>
    <p> In Brazil, there are entire industries and traditions dedicated to football,
      making it one of the most important elements of Brazilian culture. Everyone has
      a national team they support and follow, regardless of age or gender. In fact,
      children are taught from a young age to support one of their parents' teams. </p>
