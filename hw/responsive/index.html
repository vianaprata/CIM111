<h2 id="brief_history">Brief History</h2>
<p> Brazil was officially "discovered" in 1500, when a fleet commanded by Portuguese
  diplomat Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, on its way to India, landed in Porto Seguro, between
  Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. At the end of the 17th century, the news that fabulous
  veins of emeralds, diamonds, and gold had been found in Minas Gerais exploded in Lisbon.
  The region began to export 30,000 pounds of gold a year to Portugal. Bandeirantes and
  other fortune hunters rushed in from all over, and boat loads of carpenters, stonemasons,
 sculptors, and painters came from Europe to build cities in the Brazilian wilderness. Pedro II's
 daughter, Princess Isabel, officially ended slavery in 1888. Soon after, disgruntled
 landowners united with the military to finish with monarchy altogether, forcing the
 royal family back to Portugal and founding Brazil's first republican government on
 November 15, 1889.

<h2 id="geographic_regions">Geographic Regions</h2>
<p> The country is divided into 5 main regions:
  <ol>
    <li> North (Norte). </li>
    <li> Northeast (Nordeste). </li>
    <li> Central-West (Centro-Oeste). </li>
    <li> Southeast (Sudeste). </li>
    <li> South (Sul). </li>
  </p>

      <section class="blue box">
<h2 id="main_cultural_points">Main Cultural Points</h2>
<p> The cultures of the indigenous Indians, Africans, and Portuguese have together
  formed the modern Brazilian way of life. The Portuguese culture is by far the dominant
  of these influences; from it Brazilians acquired their language, their main religion,
  and most of their customs. African influences on the Brazilian way of life are strongest
   along the coast between the Northeast and Rio de Janeiro; they include traditional
    foods, religions, and popular music and dance, especially the samba.

  <h2 id="rio_de_janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</h2>
  <p> I was born in a city called Belo Horizonte, but moved to Rio de Janeiro when I was young. My heart belongs to Rio de Janeiro and I feel completely'Carioca'; a term
    used to describe a person from Rio de Janeiro who has certain characteristics. Rio de Janeiro is a coastal city in Brazil on the southeast of the country. </p>
